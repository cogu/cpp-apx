# APX for C++

This is the new [APX](https://cogu.github.io/apx/) for C++ implementation.

## Implementation Status

This repo is in early stages of development and just contains a set of classes with unit tests.

## Reasons for this repo

1. Learn C++20 (I have never used C++ 11, 14 or 17 before either).
2. Create a new and optimized C++ client implementation of APX.
3. Allow building standalone (native C++) or with optional Qt-bindings.
4. Will at some point replace [qt-apx](https://github.com/cogu/qt-apx/) (when quality is good enough).
