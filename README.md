# APX for C++

This is the new [APX](https://cogu.github.io/apx/) for C++ implementation.

Reasons for this repo:
1. Learn C++20.
2. Create a new and optimized C++ client implementation of APX.
3. Allow building standalone (native C++) or with Qt-bindings.
4. Will at some point replace [qt-apx](https://github.com/cogu/qt-apx/) (when quality is good enough).
