# APX for C++

This is the new [APX](https://cogu.github.io/apx/) for C++ implementation.

## Implementation Status

This repo is in early stages of development and mostly contains a set of classes with unit tests.

## Reasons for this repo

1. Learn C++20.
2. Create a new implementation of APX optimized for modern C++.
3. Allow both standalone build (native C++) or build against QT APIs.
4. Will at some point replace [qt-apx](https://github.com/cogu/qt-apx/) (when quality is good enough).
